# RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages. You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting in a post box, you can be sure that the letter carrier will eventually deliver the mail to your recipient. In this analogy, RabbitMQ is a post box, a post office, and a letter carrier.

The major difference between RabbitMQ and the post office is that it doesn't deal with paper, instead it accepts, stores, and forwards binary blobs of data â€’ messages.

## Jargon

### Producer

A program that sends messages is a ***producer***.

### Queue

A queue is the name for the post box in RabbitMQ. Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they can only be stored inside a queue. A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits, it's essentially a large message buffer.

Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue.

### Consumer

A ***consumer*** is a program that mostly waits to receive messages.
